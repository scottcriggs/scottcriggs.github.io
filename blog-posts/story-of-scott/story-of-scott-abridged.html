        <h1>My Journey in Materials Science and AI</h1>

        <h2>Not all those who wander are lost, some are tricked by physics</h2>
        <image src="planes-chains-orbits.jpg" class="planes-chains-orbits-poster">
        <p>A long time ago, in a galaxy close by (hint, it's this one), a fresh-faced 
            CS major was lollygagging across campus. "Lollygagging" is the correct 
            southern nomenclature here, folks, because it was the summer and in the 
            south that's as fast as one can humanily move. It just so happend that day 
            the Phyics department were having some kind of science demo, only instead of 
            volcanoes made of baking soda, they had… levitation.  A little black disk, 
            floating in the air like it had just won a staring contest with gravity and 
            was feeling rather smug about it.  Underneath, a rare-earth magnet. 
            "How...." I inquired, with the wide-eyed innocence of youth (here innoncence 
            refers to the lack of having spent anytime in graduate school), 
            "is that… floating?"  "We don't know," they shrugged.  "Say again. We don't 
            know?" I sputtered. "It's… floating!  You don't know?!"  Seven years later, 
            now armed with a PhD in experimental condensed matter physics specializing 
            in this material (and a crippling caffeine addiction), I can now confidently 
            tell you if you ask me why this material levitates… I don't know. </p>

        <h2>Postdoctoral Work and the Limitations of Traditional Methods</h2>

        <p>My postdoctoral work at Stanford University with Ian Fisher focused on 
            materials growth, where I experienced firsthand the limitations of 
            traditional methods for materials synthesis. The process of developing 
            growth recipes was time-consuming and inefficient, often requiring a 
            trial-and-error one-knob-at-a-time approach with limited guidance.</p>

        <h2>The Dawn of AI in Materials Science</h2>

        <p>In 2016, the potential of AI to revolutionize materials science was 
            highlighted on the cover of Nature. After reading that issue (and many cited 
            papers), I was bought in, and transitioned from academia to industry, 
            focusing on applying machine learning techniques for process optimization 
            at Lam Research.</p>

        <h2>Industry Experience and Leadership</h2>

        <p>After five successful years at Lam Research, where I spearheaded the 
            development and implementation of machine learning models for process 
            optimization, I transitioned to Applied Materials as a Senior Data Science 
            Manager. In this leadership role, my focus shifted to shaping the company's 
            broader AI vision and strategy within the materials science domain. This 
            involved not only providing technical guidance and developing advanced AI 
            solutions, but also translating complex technical details into digestible 
            insights for cross-functional teams across various Business Units. I 
            championed the adoption of AI-driven approaches by creating comprehensive 
            roadmaps and demonstrating the transformative potential of AI to accelerate 
            materials discovery and development. My role at Applied was centered around 
            evangelizing a data-driven mindset and fostering a culture of innovation to 
            address critical challenges in materials science.</p>

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

        <p>Now, with eight years of experience honing my AI skills, I'm eager to combine 
            my expertise with my enduring passion for materials science. I'm seeking an 
            opportunity to contribute to the advancement of this field and drive 
            innovation through the power of AI. I'd love to meet! Let's connect!</p>
