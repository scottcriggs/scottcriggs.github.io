        <h1>My Journey in Materials Science and AI</h1>

        <p>My fascination with materials began unexpectedly during my undergraduate years 
            at a physics demonstration. Witnessing a high-temperature superconductor 
            levitate above a magnet sparked an intense curiosity within me. The idea 
            that such a phenomenon could exist without a complete understanding of its 
            underlying mechanisms ignited a passion that led me to pursue a PhD in 
            condensed matter physics.</p>

        <h2>Postdoctoral Work and the Limitations of Traditional Methods</h2>

        <p>My postdoctoral work at Stanford University with Ian Fisher focused on 
            materials growth, where I experienced firsthand the limitations of 
            traditional methods for materials synthesis. The process of developing 
            growth recipes was time-consuming and inefficient, often requiring a 
            trial-and-error one-knob-at-a-time approach with limited guidance.</p>

        <h2>The Dawn of AI in Materials Science</h2>

        <p>In 2016, the potential of AI to revolutionize materials science was 
            highlighted on the cover of Nature. After reading that issue (and many cited 
            papers), I was bought in, and transitioned from academia to industry, 
            focusing on applying machine learning techniques for process optimization 
            at Lam Research.</p>

        <h2>Industry Experience and Leadership</h2>

        <p>After five successful years at Lam Research, where I spearheaded the 
            development and implementation of machine learning models for process 
            optimization, I transitioned to Applied Materials as a Senior Data Science 
            Manager. In this leadership role, my focus shifted to shaping the company's 
            broader AI vision and strategy within the materials science domain. This 
            involved not only providing technical guidance and developing advanced AI 
            solutions, but also translating complex technical details into digestible 
            insights for cross-functional teams across various Business Units. I 
            championed the adoption of AI-driven approaches by creating comprehensive 
            roadmaps and demonstrating the transformative potential of AI to accelerate 
            materials discovery and development. My role at Applied was centered around 
            evangelizing a data-driven mindset and fostering a culture of innovation to 
            address critical challenges in materials science.</p>

        <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

        <p>Now, with eight years of experience honing my AI skills, I'm eager to combine 
            my expertise with my enduring passion for materials science. I'm seeking an 
            opportunity to contribute to the advancement of this field and drive 
            innovation through the power of AI. I'd love to meet! Let's connect!</p>
