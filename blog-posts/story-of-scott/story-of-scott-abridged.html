            <h1>My Journey in Materials Science and AI</h1>
            <h2>Not all those who wander are lost, some are tricked by physics</h2>

            <p>A long time ago, in a galaxy close by (hint, it's this one), a 
                fresh-faced CS major was lollygagging across campus. "Lollygagging" 
                is the correct southern nomenclature here, folks, because it was the 
                summer and in the south that's as fast as one can humanely move. It 
                just so happened that day the Physics department were having some kind 
                of science demo, only instead of volcanoes made of baking soda, they 
                had… levitation. A little black disk, floating in the air like it had 
                just won a staring contest with gravity and was feeling rather smug 
                about it. Underneath, a rare-earth magnet. "How...." I inquired, with 
                the wide-eyed innocence of youth (here innocence refers to the lack of 
                having spent any time in graduate school), "is that… floating?" "We 
                don't know". "Say again. We don't know?" I sputtered. 
                "It's… floating! You don't know?!" Seven years later, now armed with a 
                PhD in experimental condensed matter physics specializing in this 
                material (and a crippling caffeine addiction), I can now confidently 
                tell you if you ask me why this material levitates… &nbsp &nbsp 
                &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp 
                I don't know.</p>

            <h2>Postdoctoral Work and the Limitations of Traditional Methods</h2>
            <img class="fisher-lab-xtals" src="fisher-lab.png">
            <p>My postdoctoral work at Stanford University with Ian Fisher focused on 
                materials growth, where I experienced firsthand the limitations of 
                traditional methods for materials synthesis. The process of developing 
                growth recipes was time-consuming and inefficient, often requiring a 
                trial-and-error one-knob-at-a-time approach with limited guidance.</p>

            <img src="fb_nature.png" class="fb-nature">
            <p>In the ancient year of <b>2016</b>, the potential of AI to revolutionize 
                materials science was highlighted on the cover of Nature. After reading 
                the issue cover-to-cover, I was bought in, and left academia (I was 
                really bought in) to industry, focusing on applying Deep Learning 
                techniques for process optimization at Lam Research. That was a year
                 before the famous attention paper.</p>

        <div class="industry">
            <h2>Industry Experience and Leadership</h2>

            <p>After five successful years at Lam Research, where I spearheaded the 
                development and implementation of machine learning models for process 
                optimization, I transitioned to Applied Materials as a Senior Data Science 
                Manager. In this leadership role, my focus shifted to shaping the company's 
                broader AI vision and strategy within the materials science domain. This 
                involved not only providing technical guidance and developing advanced AI 
                solutions, but also translating complex technical details into digestible 
                insights for cross-functional teams across various Business Units. I 
                championed the adoption of AI-driven approaches by creating comprehensive 
                roadmaps and demonstrating the transformative potential of AI to accelerate 
                materials discovery and development. My role at Applied was centered around 
                evangelizing a data-driven mindset and fostering a culture of innovation to 
                address critical challenges in materials science.</p>

            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

            <p>Now, with eight years of experience honing my AI skills, I'm eager to combine 
                my expertise with my enduring passion for materials science. I'm seeking an 
                opportunity to contribute to the advancement of this field and drive 
                innovation through the power of AI. I'd love to meet! Let's connect!</p>
