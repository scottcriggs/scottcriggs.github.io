            <ul>
                <li><strong>Focus on Internal Problems:</strong> Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but customers buy solutions to internal problems.</li>
                <li><strong>Highlight the Problem:</strong> The more we talk about the problems our customers face, the more interested they will be in our brand.</li>
                <li><strong>Position Your Brand as the Solution:</strong> Position your products and services to take out their villain.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Villain doesn't have to be a person, but should be personified.</li>
                        <li>Personify customers' problems as the villain.</li>
                    </ul>

                                        <li>Customers buy from us because the external problem is frustrating them in some way. If we can identify that frustration, put it into words, and resolve that frustration along with the original external problem, we will be loved by the customer.</li>

                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Philosophical problems:</strong> Usually defined as the "ought" and "shouldn't." What is the deeper meaning?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Our product should solve all three of these problems.</li>

                                <li>Asking themselves, do they even need this (these AI tools)? Customer knows they should be using AI, but they aren't sure what to do. (We allow them to outsource, so they don't have to take on the risk of developing the internal tool. We've solved this problem over 7 years, use us).</li>

            <h2>Chapter 8: Call Customers to Action</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Challenge to Act:</strong> Customers do not take action unless they are challenged to take action.</li>
                <li><strong>Clarity and Repetition:</strong> Key to sales is clarifying the calls to action and repeating them.</li>
                <li><strong>Passive Communication:</strong> Communicating passively signals a lack of belief in your product.</li>
                <li><strong>Directness:</strong> The guide needs to be direct to the hero about what they want them to do.</li>
                <li><strong>Two Kinds of Calls to Action:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Direct Calls to Action:</strong> (i.e., something that leads to a sale)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Buy now!</li>
                                <li>Call today!</li>
                                <li>Schedule an Appointment!</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Transitional Calls to Action:</strong> (usually entails less risk and usually involves something free)
                            <ul>
                                <li>Download a PDF</li>
                                <li>Watch an informative video</li>

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Both Are Essential:</strong> Always have both a direct call to action (goal is to make a sale) and a transitional call to action.</li>
                <li><strong>Pursue Your Customers:</strong> As a brand, it's our job to pursue our customers.</li>
                <li><strong>Persistence Pays Off:</strong> Those that ask again and again receive.</li>
                <li><strong>Website Implementation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have an obvious button that lets the customer have a direct call to action (like a buy-now button). Have it in multiple places; don't be afraid of repetition.</li>
                        <li>At the end of every email.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Chapter 9: Avoid a Tragic Ending</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Every human being is trying to avoid a tragic ending.</li>
                <li>Hero is motivated by two things:
                    <ul>
                        <li>To escape something bad</li>
                        <li>Experience something good</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The "so-what" question every customer is secretly asking: Where is the mayhem? All brands must answer this question.</li>
                <li>Answer the question, "What is there to lose by not using our product?"</li>
                <li>Don't fear-monger, but you must bring up the negative stakes and emphasize potential loss.</li>
                <li>Loss Aversion: A great motivator is Loss Aversion; people are more likely to be dissatisfied by a loss than satisfied by a gain.</li>
                <li>Follow a Fear Appeal:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Make a customer know they are vulnerable to a threat.</li>
                        <li>Let the customer know, since they are vulnerable, they should take action to decrease their vulnerability.</li>
                        <li>Let the customer know about a specific call to action that protects them from the risk.</li>
                        <li>Challenge people to take this specific action.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Fear is the salt in a recipe. We don't need a lot of it, just a pinch.</li>
                <li>Too much fear and it doesn't work.</li>
                <li>Ask the question, what are we helping the customer avoid?</li>
                <li><strong>Brainstorm questions:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Write down at least three negative consequences we are helping our customers avoid (e.g., money, health, etc.).</li>
                        <li>Write down an example of fear appeal in the 4-steps.</li>

                <li>Our brand should help with the identity transformation of our customers.</li>
                <li>Heroes are designed to transform.</li>
                <li><strong>Questions to ask when representing our brand:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Who does our customer want to become?</li>
                        <li>What kind of person do they want to be?</li>
                        <li>What is their aspirational identity?
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Smart brands define an aspiration identity and associate themselves with that identity.</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Best way to identify an aspirational identity that our customers may be attracted to: How does our customer want to be described by others? How does our customer want their friends to talk about them?</li>
                <li>Embolden customers with an aspirational identity; encourage their improvements, tackling their challenges as a step to personal strength, and few problems can't be conquered with a little strategy and commitment.</li>
                <li>Great brands obsess about the transformation of their customers.</li>
                <li>Heroes struggle with doubt right up until the end. A hero needs the guide to step in and tell them they are different, they are better.</li>
                <li><strong>Create an Identity Transformation:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Who does your customer want to become as it relates to our products and services?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Brainstorm:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Find the Aspirational Identity of our customer:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Who do they want to become?</li>
                                <li>How do they want to be perceived by others?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Fill out the "to" and "from" sections to identify an aspirational identity. "From" is just the opposite of whatever aspirations identity you captured in the "to" line.</li>
                    </ul>

                <li><strong>Narrative Void:</strong> Misalignment usually happens when part of the StoryBrand brand script is missing. This is a narrative void.
