                <p> The primary purpose of the book is to provide a practical guide on 
                    how to inspire and align the entire organization.
                    By sharing a clear and compelling vision, employees, stakeholders, 
                    and even customers can understand where the company is headed and 
                    their role in achieving that vision.</p>

                    Engineering Management" by Will Larson.
                </a></h3>
                <p> Systems Thinking for Engineering Management: The book emphasizes the 
                    importance of understanding and designing effective systems for 
                    managing engineering teams. It goes beyond individual leadership 
                    skills and focuses on creating the right environment and processes 
                    for engineers to thrive. A must read for all engineering managers.

                <h3><a href="book-notes/story-brand/story-brand.html">"Building a Story 
                    Brand" by Donald Miller
                </a></h3>
                <p> The book presents a framework called the "StoryBrand 7-Part 
                    Framework" (SB7) based on the structure of classic storytelling. 
                    Miller argues that customers are drawn to clear, compelling 
                    narratives, and businesses can use this framework to clarify their 
                    message and connect with their audience. The central principle of 
                    the SB7 Framework is that the customer should be the hero of the 
                    story, not the brand. The brand plays the role of the guide, 
                    helping the hero overcome challenges and achieve their goals.
                    Clarity Over Cleverness: Miller emphasizes the importance of clarity 
                    in messaging. Businesses should avoid jargon, complex language, and 
                    confusing marketing messages. Instead, they should focus on 
                    communicating their value proposition in a simple, 
                    easy-to-understand way.

                    Effective Product Management Creates Real Value" by Melissa Perri
                </a></h3>
                <p> The Build Trap is the central concept of the book. It refers to 
                    the common situation where companies become overly focused on 
                    shipping features (outputs) rather than on achieving desired 
                    outcomes and creating value for customers. Organizations caught in 
                    the build trap are essentially "feature factories," churning out 
                    products without a clear understanding of whether they are actually 
                    solving real problems or achieving business goals.
